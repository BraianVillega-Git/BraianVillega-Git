I discovered cybersecurity thanks to Watch Dogs, and since then I knew I wanted to pursue this career. I studied computer engineering for three years, where I learned about programming, networks, logic, and computer architecture. I put my studies on hold to apply that knowledge in a practical setting and focus on security. I am currently preparing to become a SOC, strengthening my skills in alert analysis, defensive tools, and technical labs, with the goal of advancing to pentesting.

- 🎓 I’m currently learning ...
  - Splunk.
  - SOAR.
  - SysLog.
- 💻 I practice daily on platforms such as LetsDefend and TryHackMe.
- 🚀 Outside of technology, 🎮 I enjoy video games, 👫 spending time with my family or friends, 👀 and watching soccer games.
